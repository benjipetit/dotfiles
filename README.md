# dotfiles

### Installation

Run the 'write' script, that will copy the dotfiles on your system:
```
$> ./write.sh
```

### Contributing

Edit your dotfiles, make sure they work properly, and import them in the repository with the 'read' script:
```
$> ./read.sh
```

### Private aliases

I have a few aliases that I don't want to share. They are in `~/.private_aliases` and are sourced in my .zshrc.
